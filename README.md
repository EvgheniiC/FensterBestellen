JS (native)

- JavaScript code must be native, without using libraries, frameworks or plugins (e.g. JQuery)
 -The console should be clear of any errors
 -The final version should be built on any modular structure. We plan to expand in the future.
 - Operability in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE11, Edge, Safari)
 - Animations are very welcome, but also left to discretion (you can change the installed classes from animate.css as you like)
 - Using ES6 +
